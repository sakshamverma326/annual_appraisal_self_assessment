#########Development and Capability Building

Over the course of the year, I focused on strengthening both my own capabilities and the overall effectiveness of the team through continuous learning, process optimization, and active leadership.

I deepened my understanding of drug pricing methodologies and their role in driving business profitability. This enhanced knowledge enabled me to better align technical solutions with business objectives and contribute more effectively to pricing-related discussions from a strategic perspective.

From a delivery and operational standpoint, I optimized multiple client data pipelines to improve efficiency, stability, and error-free execution. I also designed and developed new pipelines to support the onboarding of the Data Science team, enabling them to seamlessly run pricing algorithms in production environments. To further strengthen reliability, I proactively introduced quality control (QC) checks at each critical stage of the process, significantly reducing downstream risks and ensuring end-to-end process continuity.

In addition, I took ownership of running monthly operational processes for specific workstreams on the client side, ensuring timely execution, issue resolution, and consistent delivery without disruptions.

I also demonstrated initiative beyond core responsibilities by leading a proof of concept (POC) on the Palantir platform, aimed at replicating the NBA campaign design engine (CPL). This effort helped evaluate platform capabilities and explore future opportunities for scalable campaign design solutions.

Beyond technical contributions, I actively supported team capability building by participating in interviews for multiple roles. This experience strengthened my ability to assess candidates’ technical depth, problem-solving skills, and communication abilities, contributing to the identification and selection of strong talent for the organization.




########EXL and Client Trainings

I consistently ensured timely completion of all mandatory EXL and client-required trainings throughout the year. I proactively tracked training requirements and deadlines to remain fully compliant with organizational and client standards. By completing these trainings on schedule, I stayed up to date with company policies, client expectations, data security, and compliance requirements, enabling me to perform my role responsibly and without any delivery or governance risks. I would also like to thank my manager for regularly sharing reminders and guidance, which helped ensure consistent and timely completion of all required trainings.





#########C-SAT Rating (Target) / Client SLAs

Throughout the year, I consistently delivered high-quality, accurate, and well-validated work within committed timelines, ensuring full adherence to client SLAs. I maintained a strong focus on clean deliverables, thorough validation, and proactive issue resolution, which helped minimize rework and ensured smooth downstream consumption by client teams.

As a result, I received regular positive feedback and appreciation from clients, often shared via email and with key stakeholders such as Ankit, Aditya, and Kanika cc’ed. This consistent client recognition reflects a high level of customer satisfaction, trust, and confidence in my work. By combining reliability, attention to detail, and timely delivery, I contributed positively to sustained C-SAT scores and strengthened long-term client relationships.






#######Delivery Quality and Timeliness

Throughout the year, I consistently delivered all assigned deliverables on time while maintaining a high standard of technical quality, accuracy, and reliability. I demonstrated strong ownership by independently handling complex technical responsibilities across critical client workstreams, ensuring seamless delivery without escalations.

A key contribution was my end-to-end ownership of the compute migration project for the client’s Specialty workstream. I independently managed the technical design, execution, and validation of the migration, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing operations while meeting all committed deadlines. In parallel, I continued to successfully run monthly production processes for the same workstream, balancing migration activities with ongoing operational commitments.

In addition to migration efforts, I led multiple enhancements to existing processes to improve scalability and flexibility. This included redesigning and optimizing current pipelines to support the onboarding of new client businesses, enabling faster and more efficient integration without compromising data quality or timelines. I also developed ad hoc and configurable processing frameworks for the Specialty workstream, allowing individual clients to be run independently for custom timeframes based on business needs. This significantly improved operational agility and reduced dependency on rigid batch cycles.

I consistently followed and reinforced engineering best practices, including structured pipeline development, robust error handling, comprehensive QC checks, and performance optimization. By proactively identifying risks and addressing potential issues early, I ensured stable, repeatable execution and maintained a zero-escalation record from business and client stakeholders throughout the year.

Overall, my technical expertise, strong ownership mindset, and ability to independently manage complex initiatives contributed to high delivery quality, timely execution, and sustained stakeholder confidence.s
